      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our team is made up of thinkers, doers, and builders. We have some of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading experts in virtualization, cryptography, systems engineering, and networking, and we routinely uncover entirely new technological territory as we advance our solutions. We intend to stay on the leading edge, write great code, build amazing engineered systems, delight customers, and enjoy the journey as much as the destination.  We hire great people based on expertise, skill, passion and cultural fit - if this is also appealing to you, we&amp;rsquo;d love to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;
